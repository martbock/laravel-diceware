This package makes it easy to generate passphrases that are both secure and easy to remember.

It uses [Diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) wordlists and is fully configurable to your needs.

## Usage

It is very easy to generate a random diceware password, simply use the Facade like this:

```php
$passphrase = Diceware::generate();

// returns 'unwind-cosmic-entryway-magnetic-stardust-ligament'
return $passphrase;
```

## Why use it?

For years, we trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember but easy for machines to guess.
If you don't want to frustrate your users, you should consider using something like Diceware to generate passphrases
that are easier to remember and to typewrite.

Perhaps, the problem is best explained by this famous xkcd comic:

## Installation

You can install the package via composer. 
Next, publish the `diceware.php` configuration file so can adjust the settings for this package. 

```bash
composer require martbock/laravel-diceware
php artisan vendor:publish --provider 'Martbock\Diceware\DicewareServiceProvider'
```

## Configuration

You may change the default settings in the [diceware.php config file](config/diceware.php) that will be published to
your Laravel config directory once you install this package. Currently, the following options are supported:

```php
'number_of_words'       => 6,
'separator'             => '-',
'capitalize'            => false,
'wordlist'              => 'english',
'custom_wordlist_path'  => null,
'number_of_dice'        => 5,
```

Of course, you can use your own wordlist, just set the `custom_wordlist_path` accordingly.
